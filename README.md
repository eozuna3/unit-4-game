This is the 4th assignment Crystals Collector Game. This assignement specifically utilized more jquery and some javascript in order to create a crystal collector number guessing game. This assignment is an intital introduction into the world of using jquery and provided my as the programmer first hand experience with using Jquery and allowing my webpages to interact with the user.

When game initially loads the user is given the instructions for the game.  The jquery code also creates and randomly selected number for the player to reach and it creates random values for each of the crystal buttons.  The player can start playing the game immediately or create a whole new game with a new selected number and new values for each button.  The game continues until the user correctly gets to the selected number without going over or it goes over the selected number.  The game does not allow them to continue clicking buttons if they lost or won without starting a new game entirely.  

It utilizes several javascript functions for making the game function properly. There are seperate functions linked to each button to update the DOM of the page.  Each of the button functions calls on other functions to actually do the updating of the DOM based on wins and losses.
